##Liftover Steps
I did small modifications to the steps and files listed here `http://genomewiki.ucsc.edu/index.php/Same_species_lift_over_construction`

You need to have kentUtils installed properly to run this.

1. FaToTwoBit your original .fa file to .2bit file.
2. SameSpeciesBlatSetup.sh
3. SameSpeciesChainNet.sh
